  Minesweeper
</h2>

Minesweeper is a 90's video game originally created by Microsoft. The given board resembles a graph table where each square contians a hidden element that could be either a mine,
an empty cell or a digit. Every digit represents the number of mines adjacent to it. If a cell is empty (grey), it means that there are no mines adjacent to it.

The objective of the game is to find out where all the mines are and put a flag on each of them without opening any. If you do step on a mine, the game ends and you lose.
All digit squares need to be opened in order for you to win. <br> <br>
Tables of different difficulty levels contain different amount of squares and mines.
You can start by clicking at any random square. <br>
Regular click to open a cell. Right click to flag.

<h3>
  Levels

<h3>
  User Interface
</h3>
As stated above, you can choose any level to start with from the home page. The game could be reset both when you finish playing and before that. When you win, you can move on to the next level directly from the page you're on at the moment. Of course, if you're impatient, you can navigate to a higher or a custom level from the home page that you have access to all the time. It's more fun to earn your way to expert level, though! <br>
Unlike next level buttons, previous level navigation is always available. You can't upgrade from the highest level and downgrade form the lowest. <br>

<h3>
  To do

- Highest score records and statistics <br>

  Minesweeper
</h2>

Minesweeper is a 90's video game originally created by Microsoft. The given board resembles a graph table where each square contians a hidden element that could be either a mine,
an empty cell or a digit. Every digit represents the number of mines adjacent to it. If a cell is empty (grey), it means that there are no mines adjacent to it.

The objective of the game is to find out where all the mines are and put a flag on each of them without opening any. If you do step on a mine, the game ends and you lose.
All digit squares need to be opened in order for you to win. <br> <br>
Tables of different difficulty levels contain different amount of squares and mines.
You can start by clicking at any random square. <br>
Regular click to open a cell. Right click to flag.

<h3>
  Levels
</h3>
Easy - 9 x 9 squares, 15 mines. <br>
Medium - 16 x 16 squares, 40 mines. <br>
Hard - 16 x 30 squares, 85 mines. <br>
Expert - 23 x 34 squares, 149 mines. <br>
Custom - Anything you choose from 3 to 50 squares, 20% of which are mines. <br> 

<h3>
  Scores
</h3>
The program stores your highest score for each level - least time and least clicks.
When you update your score by taking less time or using clicks to finish a game, it's 
updated in the 'scores' page section as well. When you hit a new score you're shown
your previous one, and when you win but can't beat your own best score you see a comparison 
between your current one and your best one. By default your score is zero, but it 
gets automatically changed when you win your first game for the level. <br> 

<h3>
  User Interface
</h3>
As stated above, you can choose any level to start with from the home page, which also contains the rules.
The game could be reset both when you finish playing and before that. When you win, you can move on to the next
level directly from the page you're on at the moment. Of course, if you're impatient, you can navigate to a higher or 
a custom level from the home page that you have access to all the time. It's more fun to work your way out to expert
level, though! <br>
So, unlike next level buttons, previous level navigation is always available. <br>

<h3>
  To do
</h3>
- Random shaped tables (not just square and rectangle) <br>
- Improved design <br>
- Faster opening of the cells

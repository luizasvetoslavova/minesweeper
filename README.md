**Minesweeper**

Minesweeper is a 90's video game originally vreated by Microsoft. The board given resembles a graph table where each square contians a hidden element that could be either a mine,
an empty cell or a digit. The digit is the number of mines adjacent to it. If a cell is empty, it means that there are no mines adjacent to it.

The objective of the game is to find out where all the mines are and put a flag on each of them without actually opening any. If you do, the game ends and you lose.
All digit squares need to be opened.

Tables of different difficulty levels contain different amount of squares.

You can start by clicking at any random cell.
Regular click to open a cell. Right click to flag.
